# MERN CRUD Project with MongoDB

This project is a basic implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It provides a simple web application for managing data with MongoDB as the database, Express.js and Node.js for the backend, and React.js for the frontend.

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on data entities.
- Responsive user interface built with React.js.
- MongoDB database for data storage.
- Express.js and Node.js for backend API development.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/talhajaved-com/Crud-mongoDB.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd Crud-mongoDB
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Define MongoDB connection URI and other necessary environment variables in the `.env` file.

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Access the application:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.
